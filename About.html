        <h1> Hi there ! </h1>
        <p> <h2> My name is Khalil, and I'm the creator of this website. I like working out and sometimes I write.</h2></p>
        <p><h2> Here is one of my unfinished stories I wrote in 2017:</h2></p>
        <p><h4> 
            *Heavy rain*</h4></p>
            <p><h4>So it was a friday night, in a small city somewhere around london, at a bar with few people, a mysterious long haired man clothed in black and some old fancy glasses comes by the front door wildly that you can feel his menacing aura giving you the chills.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>His name was Vicent.
                He asks for a drink, as soon as his lips touched the glass, the few people in the bar start noticing something different in him, I’d rather say something suspiciously weird. 
                The looks started to intensify around Vicent, « You’re the man on the TV » shouted an old woman who apparently was in her 90s. </h4></p>
            <p><h4>Lisa, a maid in that bar, recognized him and couldn’t take her eyes away from him, he indeed was on the tv, there’s a bounty on his head.
                Lisa was the kind of women who loved mysteries and Vicent was one of them for her so she took the first chance that came to her and started a conversation with him; « Excuse me sir but your face is very familiar to me. Are you a singer? Because I’m sure I’ve seen you somewhere on the TV. » Lisa said with a big smile.
                Vicent looked up at Lisa’s face, she was the most beautiful woman he has ever seen since his fiancee died.  </h4></p>
            <p><h4>            « My name is Vicent, I’m a runaway. » He was worried that this beautiful woman judges him because he could already see himself spending his nights with her.
            </h4></p>
            <p><h4>             « Oh ?! So I was right, you’re the man whom the bounty was raised yesterday. » Lisa whispers so only the both of them could hear what she says.
            </h4></p>
            <p><h4>            « Nice to meet you Vicent, I’m Lisa. »             She kept smiling at him as they talked a little bit more about the small city, the boring stuff people usually start with, they somehow managed to get comfortable the one with the other; «Aren’t you afraid of me ?» Vicent asked all of a sudden.

            </h4></p>
            <p><h4> Lisa, smilingly answered him that she was not, that she had no reason to fear him.
                As Lisa began to speak, both of them notice gunshots outside the bar.
                Vicent quickly guessed that they were bounty hunters.
                The gunshots entered the bar, one or two of the few unlucky people there got hurt, five tough men broke the door shouting in some foreign language that nobody but Vicent seemed to understand.
                Lisa was panicking till she felt Vicent’s warm hand touching hers; « You are safe with me ».</h4></p>
            <p><h4> Vicent wasn’t the kind of men to say such words to women, but there was something in Lisa that made him do so. Lisa was his fiancee’s name and she too, wasn’t afraid of him.
                One of the bounty hunters shot at Vicent’s drink; « We found ya, Vicent the silver eye ! »
                He wasn’t the type of men to easily get irritated, but at that moment, Vicent didn’t have a choice but to thrust into a fight with five men, * «skeewiff - coming home baby » playing* he didn’t want to kill anybody so he took a chair and began fighting with it breaking it into pieces each time a man attacks him. 
                First man down, Vicent wasn’t exhausted at all, he was smiling, you can feel him enjoying the fight, Lisa helped in the fight, she took a kitchen knife and stabbed a hunter that was about to shoot Vicent.
                «What the hell is a kitchen knife doing in a bar?!» Vicent humoredly asking.
                « "A thanks for saving my ass" wouldn’t hurt anybody.» She furiously answered, «There are a lot of thieves in this city by night, I always have a knife on me, this is my first time using it, it feels good though.» 
                One of the bounty hunters got scared of the duo and ran away, Vicent took out his gun and pointed it at their boss as the man left pointed his at him.
                *Gunshot noise*
                The bounty hunter shot Vicent but didn’t hit him, it hit his glasses, broke them.
                Vicent the silver eye, he had two different eyes, a green and a grey one, the grey one was his fiancee’s, she died in a car accident after a fight with him a month ago with a last wish.
                </h4></p>
            <p><h4> «Vicent darling,</h4></p>
            <p><h4>            Tonight’s fight was because of me, I wanted to apologize sooner but I couldn’t resist seeing you with that woman, I promise that it won’t happen again, I love you more than anything in this world so don’t stay mad at me for so long, another thing, swear to me that if I die tonight you will take my left eye and make it yours.
            </h4></p>
            <p><h4>             I’m sorry for everything.
            </h4></p>
            <p><h4>                        I love you.
            </h4></p>
            <p><h4> Dianna»</h4></p>
            <p><h4> Sadly, the bullet didn’t only break Vicent’s glasses, it also hit Lisa’s stomach..
                Vicent couldn’t resist seeing Lisa suffering, he held her, flipped a table using it as a protection as he started shooting the hunters with extreme precision, he killed both of them.
                He took Lisa outside, even if she’s hurt they finished the conversation;</h4></p>
            <p><h4>            *Fever - peggy lee*
            </h4></p>
            <p><h4>              Vicent: I’ve been held up in this city for a while due to the rain.
            </h4></p>
            <p><h4>            Lisa: Oh so as soon that it stops raining you leave.
            </h4></p>
            <p><h4>             Vicent: I hope the rain never stops.
            </h4></p>
            <p><h4>            Lisa: What..?
            </h4></p>
            <p><h4>            Vicent: if it continues I’ll be able to stay here forever.
            </h4></p>
            <p><h4>             Lisa: *Gives him a laugh followed by multiple coughs*
            </h4></p>
            <p><h4>             Vicent: it wasn’t meant to be a joke, Lisa.
            </h4></p>
            <p><h4> He took advantage of her being so vulnerable and kissed her under that heavy rain.
                Unfortunately Lisa couldn’t make it, the bullet pierced one of her vitals, she was dead even before they could enjoy their moment.
                *"careless whispers" playing*
                Few days later, Vicent’s body was found in a street not very far from the bar, the cause of his dead was an overdose of Dextromethorphan, generally known as the cough syrup.
                Lisa was the woman Dianna saw with Vicent, Lisa didn’t know that she was the main reason of an innocent woman’s death.
                Vicent was good looking, smarter than average, he had almost any woman he wanted, but none of that mattered because he was a cheater, his lack of sincerity cost him Dianna, Lisa and his life.
